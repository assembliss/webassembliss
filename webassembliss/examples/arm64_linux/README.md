# Examples

The examples in this folder show how to:
- output something (`hello.S`)
- timeout a program (`infiniteLoop.S`)
- input and output somethign (`ioExample.S`)
- work with multiple source files (`multiDriver.S` and `sampleLib.S`)
- work with C-driver code (`cDriver.c` and `sampleLib.S`)

You can either run `make` to assemble and link everything or take a look at the `Makefile` to see what commands are used.
